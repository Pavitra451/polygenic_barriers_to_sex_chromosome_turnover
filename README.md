# SLiM code associated with Muralidhar 2024 preprint "Polygenic barriers to sex chromosome turnover"

This folder contains the SLiM code used in the Muralidhar 2024 preprint titled "Polygenic barriers to sex chromosome turnover". Please consult the Methods section of the preprint for details on the simulations. Simulations are coded in the SLiM evolutionary simulation framework, which can be downloaded here: https://messerlab.org/slim/. All simulations were run in SLiM 4.1, but higher versions of SLiM should preserve backwards comptability. 

The 4 files in this directory are: 
Basic_model.slim 
Environmental_sex_reversal.slim
Shift_in_optimum.slim
Two_traits.slim

The first of these, "Basic_model.slim" has the most detailed annotations, so please read through this code first. The other SLiM files contain variations upon this basic model. 

Please feel free to reach out to pmuralidhar [at] uchicago [dot] edu with any furher questions.
